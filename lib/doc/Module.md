# Unleash Proxy Client

The Unleash Proxy Client SDK connects to a Unleash Proxy.
A client SDK will poll the Proxy at regular intervals and cache all the data in memory. 
The purpose of a Client SDK is to make it simple to take advantage of Unleash in client applications.
It also removes the need for evaluating toggles client side so the library can be significantly less complex than our current Client SDKs are
